# crstore-bun-issue

A minimal reproduction to show that Bun does not work when using the package [crstore](https://github.com/Azarattum/CRStore)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.26. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
